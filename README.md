# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh





<b> Form creater : </b>

    This is the money tracker app in which the user keeps the track of his own expences and awailable balance over the webpage.

    Here we have used simple react frontend for the representation of the data.

    For data base we are using mongodb atlas.

    login to mongodb atlas using the new email moneytracker365@gmail.com . Password is in recovery email drive.
    ``` [ mongodb+srv://moneytracker365:GN2vgZTOTOOAKdKm@cluster0.zvw3g.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0 ] ```


    we need to add .env file to give the uri 's into the project and to access it we need to add the dotenv pacage and to run config() thing.

    ~ npm install dotenv 
     add   require('dotenv').config();  // Load environment variables from .env file
     to js file
